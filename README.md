# Genetic-Algorithm-Test
Simple implementation of a genetic algorithm using Python. Which is used to approximate sin(x).

# Methodology
There are to programs in this repository. The first is a simple, na√Øve implementation of a genetic algorithm, which evolves by altering a string. The second is a work-in-progress version, which has improved understanding of the mathematics involved, by modeling the structures as a tree. Each node in the tree has an associated operator and arguments, which could be a number or another node.

## Results
The simple program
